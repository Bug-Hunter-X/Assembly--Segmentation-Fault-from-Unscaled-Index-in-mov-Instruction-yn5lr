mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction accesses memory using scaled indexing.  If the value in ecx is unexpectedly large, it could lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the allocated data, causing a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  This is especially problematic if ecx is not properly validated before this instruction is executed.
